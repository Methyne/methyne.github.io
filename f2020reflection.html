<h2><b>Fall 2020 Reflection </b></h2>
</p>

<p>
My experience in SDU, while barely improving my own understanding of science, has helped me understand exactly how much the public understands science. Knowing how much the public knows is an important part of framing how and how much our culture supports the functions and roles of science. During my 1st semester, I learned about various logical fallacies, unsound beliefs, and pseudoscientific topics. Through the semester, I gained a greater understanding of how the public could fall victim to these modes of thinking, thereby learning one important aspect of how our culture does not support science. Specifically, the scientific method and scientific thinking is not covered properly in high schools and colleges. 
</p>
<p>
Our culture does not support the function of science in promoting healthy skepticism. When I talk about skepticism and science, I do not mean dogmatism or refusing to change your beliefs, but rather statements like &quot;too good to be true&quot; and &quot;but why?&quot; For example, many people receiving a psychic reading or listening to someone else receive one never stopped to consider that such a power may be too good to be true, that there could be something else behind a supposed psychic. Before entering SDU, I simply thought that the psychics were experienced guessers and hid behind vague predictions. However, after learning about cold reading in CPSD100, I knew exactly what they did, how the practice could be debunked, why people would fall for it, and what this says about public understanding of science.
</p>
<p>
I do not remember as much from the other 2 SDU classes (101 & 200) regarding culture and science. 101 was full of guest speakers, astronomy, and the history of astronomy. 200 mentioned science in the media. There is something to be said about how our culture supports the current state of scientific journalism due to people clicking on articles with misleading headlines, not doing extra factchecking, sometimes even reading a headline without reading the corresponding article etc., but I risk going beyond what was covered in class and thus mentioning things irrelevant to the prompt by diving further into the topic.  
</p>
<p>
My science classes have not covered similar insights simply because I have barely taken any science courses in UMD. In fact, besides my math and computer science courses, which cast no shadow on &quot;how our culture supports (or doesn&#39;t) the functions and roles of science&quot;, the only STEM class I took was BSCI189I, a general education course which reviewed basic biology, then talked about human diversity and the myth of race. There was one day when we reviewed the scientific method, and a few times when we discussed public beliefs in some topic related to the intersection of science and race, but besides that, nothing relevant to the quoted question. Thus, without SDU almost all the insight into the prompt question would&#39;ve had to come from anything I learned either by myself or through education before college. 
</p>
<p>
Critical measured skepticism has been useful outside of SDU, mainly in organizing activities and estimating participation. After considerable student participation in my high school extracurriculars and the failure of people to show up in respectable numbers during college, I changed from a optimistic and naive approach to a careful, skeptic outlook when it came to getting people with a common interest to turn up to meetings. The math team, Quizbowl club had 20, 80 people respectively per meeting on average in high school, compared to 5-10, 10 respectively in UMD. Furthermore, the math team met weekly in high school while it took the UMD math club until fall 2020 and a change of leadership to go from 6 people and 1 meeting per semester to weekly meetings with 10 people. Instead of asking why people were showing up much less despite UMD having 20 times more (undergrad) students than my high school, I asked myself who exactly were the people boosting participation rates in high school. 
</p>
<p>
Upon reflection, it turns out that many factors driving participants in high school were absent in college. No one was showing up to boost resumes or applications, no one was showing up because their parents asked them to, and there were no donut hunters (a notorious trend in my high school&#39;s Quizbowl club; my coach once chased down, jokingly or not, a person who snuck in the middle of the year just to grab a donut without being in the club). If those people were removed from my high school clubs, the numbers could drop quite a bit. Also, some people might&#39;ve chose not to continue in college due to being tired or bored of an activity by the end of high school. On the bright side, the proportion of people taking an activity seriously has increased. College has winnowed out most casual players and left those who do an activity mainly for fun without expecting any sort of reward. 
</p>
<p>
I have had opportunities to contribute to Scholars, but not the general Scholars program. I&#39;ve shown up to What the Hell, pizza hour, excursions, and SDU social hour whenever these activities were available, but I&#39;m not sure exactly how these count as contributions. If talking to other students outside of class is what makes these activities a &quot;contribution&quot;, you can count these. I was going to also help other students out with math and show up to finals donuts. However, I forgot about the review meeting for the former and the latter got cancelled. The only activities relevant to the generals Scholars program in my 1.5 years so far have been the kickball tournament, some trivia tournament, and any activities from the beginning of fall 2019 (nothing this semester of course, but mysteriously there was no flurry of events for the start of spring 2020 either). The kickball tournament would&#39;ve been by far the biggest opportunity to interact with all sorts of Scholars students, but it got cancelled. To make it easier to contribute to Scholars in general, more activities should be offered.
