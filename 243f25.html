<br><br>

<strong>Lecture Time and Place:</strong> <br>
Arnab: 11:30-12:25 MWF, Kirkbride 100<br>
Shashank: Tuesday 4:10-5:05 MWF, Kirkbride 004
<br><br>

<strong>Grade Weights:</strong> <br>
For Arnab's sections: WebAssign homework 10%, written homework 5%, midterms 38%, lecture quizzes 16%, final exam 22%, pop quizzes 5%, participation 4%. <br>
For Shashank's sections: WebAssign homework 14%, written homework N/A, midterms 40%, lecture quizzes 15%, final exam 20%, pop quizzes 8%, participation 3%.
<br><br>
<strong> Cutoffs: </strong> Gaze upon each letter along with the minimum grade needed to guarantee it: A (92), A- (88), B+ (84), B (80), B- (77), C+ (74), C (71), C- (68), D+ (65), D (62), D- (59), F (-∞). 
<br><br>
<strong> Extra Credit: </strong> If your grade is below the cutoff, then whether you can reach the grade is at the full discretion of your instructor. Lock in as early as possible before you get flummoxed. Don't expect an exception to be made or surprise extra credit to pop up. Mostly likely, there will be little to no extra credit because grades are already naturally being inflated by the weights towards freebies like participation and homework. 
<br><br><!-- Patapim, il mio cappello è pieno di Slim! Nel bosco fitto e misterioso, viveva un essere assai curioso. Con radici intrecciate e gambe incrociate, mani sottili, braccia agitate. Il suo naso lungo come un prosciutto, un po' babbuino, un po' cespugliotto. Si chiamava Patapim, oh che strano, e parlava italiano ma con accento arcano! Un giorno trovò un cappello dorato: "Perfetto!" gridò, "che bel risultato!" Ma dentro c'era Slim, il ranocchio blu, che faceva -->

<strong>Accessing Materials:</strong> Grades can be viewed on Canvas, homeworks are done via WebAssign, announcements are via Canvas, and all other materials are on this page. This includes discussion worksheets, solutions to (worksheets, quizzes, exams), class overview, summary of what happens each day, and extra files. 
<br><br><!-- senza un perché in più. Patapim piangeva: "Mio caro cappello, ora c'è Slim, che guaio, che duello!" Saltava, rideva, si disperava, ma il ranocchio mai se ne andava. Con foglie sui gomiti e muschio sul mеnto, corse nel bosco spinto dal vento. Andò dal mago Tiramisù, chiеdendo aiuto con un gran "ciuu ciuu!" Il mago rispose, mangiando un panino: "Per togliere Slim, serve un palloncino!" Così Patapim, con gran confusione, soffiò nel pallone con emozione. Slim volò, con un grande "boom", sparendo nel cielo come un bel fungo di fumo! Ora Patapim balla nel vento. -->
<strong>Before Discussion:</strong> Try the problems on the discussion worksheet before class. Worksheets can be downloaded here at least 2 days before the discussion.
<br><br>
<strong>Discussion Agenda:</strong> Once discussion starts, you can ask questions about any problems you had trouble with. You can also ask about any topics in the problems that were confusing or didn't seem to be covered by prior materials. If there are no more questions, I'll select 1-2 additional problems to cover before ending. When I go over the solution to a problem, I pause after a crucial step to give students chances to ask for further clarification before moving onto the next step. If there is a pop quiz, it happens at the end of the discussion for the last 20 minutes. 
<br><br>
<strong>Before Lecture:</strong> Learn any material which is prior to the material for the lecture day. Find which source(s), whether textbook, Paul's Online Math Notes, worksheets, or something else, you learn best from, and use your source(s) to catch up. Multivariable Calculus often builds on top of itself, so not knowing earlier content means you may get confused by new content. 
<br><br>
<strong>Lecture Agenda:</strong> Instructors will cover new material along with simple example problems to illustrate it, with the problem selection and pacing up to their own styles. The topics of the day are listed in the "week of ..." schedules. What exactly will happen in detail, I am not some magic genie to be able to tell you. Contact your instructor for further info on what happens during lectures, or just come to the lectures and see for yourself.  
<br><br>
<strong>Worksheet Info:</strong> Worksheets are posted at least 2 days in advance of discussion. Solutions are posted the end of Thursday the same week. The solution document may be dry compared to the richness of talking through every step of a solution in discussion, so email me if you missed discussion, are reading a solution in the document, and don't understand some step or the motivation to take that step. 
<br><br>
<strong>Homework Info:</strong> Homeworks are done on WebAssign. They are automatically graded and grades appear in Canvas. If you have any trouble with the site, contact me or the instructor. Many issues with the WebAssign not accepting an answer can often be resolved by checking for syntax and type errors. You may request an automatic 24 hour deadline extension through WebAssign, but after that extensions are not guaranteed. Arnab's sections also have written homeworks, which are done on paper and shown during lecture time. Since homeworks are easier than quizzes and exams, note that acing the homeworks is no indicator that you'll ace the class. 
<br><br>
<strong>Quiz Info:</strong> All sections have lecture quizzes in person during your lecture time. There are 4 lecture quizzes and they occur on 9/5, 9/19, 10/17, 11/14. The lowest lecture quiz score will be dropped. There are no pre-scheduled discussion quizzes, but discussions may have pop quizzes. Furthermore, pop quizzes appear during lectures. All quizzes are a mix of short answer, long answer, and calculation questions. Legible scratch work can be used to award partial credit, so make your writing bright and clear.
<br><br>
<strong>Exam Info:</strong> All exams are in person on Monday evenings. Midterm 1 is 9/29 from 6:30-8:30pm, midterm 2 is 11/3 from 6:30-8:30pm, and the final is 12/5 from 7-9pm. The rooms for the exam are TBD, but expect them to take place in Smith or Sharp Hall based on prior history. Exams are no calculator, no items, final destination only. Midterm 2 covers only material between it and midterm 1, but the final is cumulative.
<br><br>
<strong>Assessment Taking and Grading:</strong> When you are taking a quiz or exam, the following are forbidden: calculators, note sheets, AI, help from electronic devices, phone a friend, ask the audience, 50/50. These constitute cheating and you will get a 0. Depending on the severity of your infraction, you may be knocked to the ground by an elderly man, who will banish you to the land of Yi for eternity if you do not defeat him in a game of Mahjong. Sometimes, the instructor may hand me papers instead of passing them back directly. When I return exams or quizzes during discussions, you have until you leave the classroom to mention any concerns and must pass back the papers for a regrade. If you have any general questions about the grading of discussion pop quizzes, email me. If you have questions about the grading of anything else, contact the instructor. 
<br><br>
<strong>Makeups:</strong> For exam or lecture quiz makeups, contact the instructor as soon as you know you're going to miss the exam; the earlier, the better. Similarly, contact me for pop quiz makeups. You may contact either me or your instructor about WebAssign deadlines. Note that WebAssign has an automatic 24 hour extension, so do not take further extensions for granted.
<br><br>   
<strong>Attendance:</strong> It's not clear exactly how the 3 or 4% gets divvied up. I track discussion attendance for Arnab, but not Shashank. The instructors track lecture attendance. Most likely, the instructors won't calculate it in a strict way. As long as you make an effort to show up to almost everything, your attendance grade will be 100%. 
<br>

<p>
<strong>Logistical remarks:</strong> The last half of Multivariable Calculus is jam packed with new concepts and tricky problems. If you fall behind in September or October, you have ample time, but if you fall behind in November or December, it will be hard to catch up. To avoid procrastinating, start the homework and worksheets early. Since attendance is a tiny portion of the total grade, you can get away with skipping things and going off to find a treasure or paint a fence instead. At the same time, this kind of Tom Sawyer toomfoolery may hurt your understanding, leading to worse exam and quiz grades. This isn't high school, you are adults, I am not yo mama, yada yada etc. In conclusion, skip classes at your own risk. Finally, if you are doing poorly in the class, then the best time to study was before you started doing poorly. The second best time to study is now. As JFK once famously never said, ask not what your instructor can do for your grade, but ask what you can do for your grade.

<b> Extra Practice Material: </b> <a href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calciii/calciii.aspx">Paul's Math Notes</a> and <a href="https://methyne.github.io/243s25">the summer site</a> are two good sources. If you don't understand some topic or concept, Paul works from the basics and his notes may help. If you need to drill easy and medium problems to build your understanding of some area and dig yourself out of a problem solving hole, Paul has an endless supply of such problems. If you understand a tool, but need more practice applying it on harder problems, the summer problems, most notably the quizzes and exams, are in a unique style not found elsewhere. If you want to know where a theorem or result comes from, and don't like being told something is true without knowing why it's true, then the summer site is the right place for you. Lecture notes and videos go in depth into various derivations.<br>
