<h2><b>Spring 2020 Reflection </b></h2>
</p>

<p>
The fact that Scholars constituted (and may again in the fall) a live and learn program helped slightly. Living specifically in Centreville meant that I ran into people from my SDU class more frequently and was able to reach SDU related sites (offices, classrooms, places where events take place etc.) much faster. This had no significant effect on my college experience, although it was convenient to walk for 1 minute instead of 5 minutes when trying to visit some of my friends. What the hell and the pizza advisory board meetings were useful and allowed me to discuss topics with people in SDU that I normally wouldn&#39;t have discussed at all. The opportunity to talk about what is going on in the news once every 2-3 weeks was nice, but the opportunity itself doesn&#39;t seem to matter much in the long run like most of our lives. Nothing would change if WTH and PABM went away, but these activities were a great way to spend an hour on Thursdays if you weren&#39;t planning on doing anything else.
</p>
<p>

Overall, I enjoyed the experiences granted by Scholars and SDU due to how many activities were available outside the weekly colloquiums. I particularly liked the New York trip during the fall, and was planning on going to the Greenbank trip before it got cancelled. The New York trip was interesting because I got to go to the Museum of Natural History and see what it&#39;s like to eat in New York. I couldn&#39;t sleep on Friday, so I slept a lot on Saturday to catch up and missed my opportunity to tour the city. I relearned what I had already known from a different perspective. The next time I visit New York, I will bring a hat because walking around the city makes you cold much faster than you think (winds are not a joke).
</p>
<p>

As for the experiences I had that could&#39;ve went better, one obvious letdown is the campus shutdown. Online classes have made me realize just how easy it is for the vast majority of assignments and tests to be conducted online. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it reminds me that I am spending a lot on tuition (the only major item not included in refunds for this semester) to read textbooks, watch lectures, and use pre-existing course materials. This is especially true for CMSC216, a class where most people are using lectures recorded last spring due to a previous instructor delivering higher quality explanations. As a suggestion for next year, Scholars should have an extra kickball tournament in the fall to make up for the cancelled competition. Of course, it will have to occur as early in the fall as possible so that impending winter weather does not spell doom to my idea.
</p>
<p>

In my sophomore year, I will be solving more math problems, completing a rigorous introductory course on topology instead of relying on what I know from browsing Wikipedia and Math Stackexchange, continuing to go to the Quizbowl, board games, card games, and puzzle hunt clubs (4 separate clubs, not one that does all 4), learning more about measure theory and Lebesgue integration, tackling the class CMSC 351 with the one and only algorithms and parallel computing extraordinaire Clyde Kruskal, continuing to converse with Scholars fellows, getting my last general education requirements besides professional writing out of the way, preparing for the VTRMC and Putnam, and going to campus wide events again (Terps after Dark and many similar organizations will hopefully resume by August after a Spring hiatus). I dread the low amount of enthusiasm (the math club (&quot;the&quot; as there was only one club related to math) had one meeting in February to which only 6 people showed up, after which there were no more meetings and the club leader and club mailing list owner could not be reached by email; they pulled the same exact act of having one meeting and then abandoning further plans in the fall) amongst the undergraduate math community in College Park, and look forward to the math department colloquiums coming next semester, which will hopefully not be cancelled.
