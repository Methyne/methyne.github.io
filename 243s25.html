<br><br>
<strong>Lecture Time:</strong> 11:40-1:15 TR on <a href="https://udel.zoom.us/j/95046323362">Zoom</a>
<br><br>
<strong>Discussion Time:</strong> 2:30-3:50 MTWRF on <a href="https://udel.zoom.us/j/97035802794">Zoom</a>
<br><br>
<strong>Office Hours:</strong> 1:30-2:30 and 4-5 TR on <a href="https://udel.zoom.us/j/99828882688">Zoom</a>
<br><br>
<strong>Grade Breakdown:</strong> Homework 10%, quizzes 20%, midterms 35%, final 35%
<br><br>

<strong>Accessing Materials:</strong> pre-class recordings are uploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9-yohtmvWBunbnpGjRa2uGB_edAVjksJ">Youtube</a>, Zoom recordings will be saved to Canvas, and all other materials are on this page. This includes announcements, discussion worksheets, solutions to (worksheets, quizzes, exams), class overview, summary of what happens each day, and extra files. 
<br><br>
<strong>Before Discussion:</strong> Try the problems on the discussion worksheet before class. Worksheets can be downloaded here at least 2 days before the discussion.
<br><br>
<strong>Discussion Agenda:</strong> Once discussion starts, you can ask questions about any problems you had trouble with. You can also ask about any topics in the problems that was confusing or didn't seem to be covered by prior materials. If there are no more questions, I'll select 1-2 additional problems to cover before ending. When I go over the solution to a problem, I pause after crucial steps to give students chances to ask for further clarification before moving onto the next steps. 
<br><br>
<strong>Before Lecture:</strong> Before each lecture, watch the pre-lecture video and try the review problems at the end of the video.
<br><br>
<strong>Lecture Agenda:</strong> Go over the video review problems, assess student understanding, lecture on additional content, give students a few practice exercises on the additional content, brief pause for students to try them, go over the exercises. Any time remaining can be used for extra questions about the content of the day as a whole.  
<br><br>
<strong>Homework Info:</strong> Homeworks are done on WebAssign. They are automatically graded and grades appear in Canvas. If you have any trouble with the site, contact me. Many issues with the WebAssign not accepting an answer can be often resolved by first checking for syntax and type errors.  
<br><br>
<strong>Quiz Info:</strong> There will be a timed quiz on Canvas due every week, which you can start at any point before it's due. Every quiz is true/false, multiple choice, and short answer, and gets graded automatically by Canvas. To prevent cheating, you are required to upload your scratch work for all questions. Legible scratch work will be used to award partial credit for short answer questions.
<br><br>
<strong>Exam Info:</strong> Midterms are on Canvas during the lecture time, but final exam is at 2pm. You must join Zoom to take midterms or the final. Midterm 1 is 6/20 11:40am, midterm 2 is 7/3 11:40am, final is 7/12 2pm. Exams are no calculator, no items, final destination only. If you want to take the exam in advance, contact me to schedule it in-person. Taking exams online in advance is not allowed to prevent cheating, and online makeups may have different problems. The same scratch work policy for quizzes also applies to exams. 
<br><br>
<strong>Makeups:</strong> For exam makeups, contact me as soon as you know you're going to miss the exam; the earlier the better. Unless you have a very good reason, there are no quiz or homework makeups since you have a yuge window to do them.  

<p>
<strong>General remarks:</strong> Summer classes go by fast and require lots of effort each week due to the compressed schedule, so if you fall behind, it will be hard to catch up. To avoid procrastinating, start the videos, homework, and worksheets early. Lecture and discussion attendance is not mandatory and there are no attendance or participation grades, so skip classes at your own risk. If you have questions about grading, email me.
