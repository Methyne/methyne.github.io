<h3><u>Fall 2020 Excursion: First Year Book</u></h3>
Discussion of the 1st year book raised many points, with chapter 3 being the most read. It was interesting to learn that colleges game the rankings as much as students gain college admission, and one person brought up
how this is essentially a cat and mouse game. Students want to go to the top colleges, "top" is ranked by the U.S. news report, colleges game the report to appear higher so that more students will apply and they will have a better pool, which in
turn will allow the entering class to have higher stats, thus raising rankings. 
<br>
It's amazing how the math department at Saudi Arabia's King Abdulaziz University managed to exploit the ranking system without any tangible change. The fact that just hiring a dozen or so highly cited researchers,stipulating they work 3 weeks for the university, and finally list their affiliation as
King Abdulaziz University on the citation website Thomson Reuters was enough to boost the college's math department to 7th was surprising.

<h3><u>Spring 2021 Excursion: Waiter, there are Flies in my Cosmic Soup</u></h3>
<b>1. What Dr. Peel's talk told me that I didn't already know</b>
<br>
CMB (cosmic microwave background radiation) was discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, who tried to figure out the source of the noise that was obstructing their telescope. They did all sorts of stuff like cleaning bird poop out of the antenna and the signal remained, so the team decided to investigate further and the rest was history.
<br>
<b>2. What I found confusing</b>
<br>
Why didn't other telescopes pick up this noise earlier? After asking this, I was told that Bell Labs, where the team worked, had top of the line equipment and was senstitive enough to the point that the noise was actually recorded. For earlier telescopes, CMBR would've been consumed by the margin of error.
<br>
<b>3. What was new to me that I clearly understood</b>
<br>
The history of CMB images and how they got better and better with advances in measurement and telescope placement (see photo above). Measuring from the ground led to too much interference, so we had to put a telescope in space. Even then, the image would still be blurry, so it required additional processing after being produced. 
<br>
<b>4. Why the universe is finite in spacetime even if it's (possibly) infinite in space</b>
<br>
By reversing expansion of the universe back in time, astrophysicists postulated the universe started only 14 billion years ago in a "Big Bang", giving a finite time. If this is the case, the observable universe extends at most 14 Gly (billion/giga light years in any direction, hence is finite in space as well. But galaxies which are billions of light years away may have their own 14 Gly sphere, so it's possible the spheres continue to pile up and the total universe, including what we can't observe, has an infinite radius.
<br>
<b>5. What the slightly cold and slightly hot variations of the CMB are the seeds of</b>
<br>
The hot spaces are denser, containing more stars and galaxies. The cold regions are sparse and contain more empty space (empty in the sense of normal matter, there may still be plenty of dark matter there).
