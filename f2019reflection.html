<h2><b>Fall 2019 Reflection </b></h2>
</p>

<p>
<h4><u>1: A moment in another class where you saw a connection between the content in the class and a personal experience</u></h4>
The first homework for my Math 340 class asked us to prove that if A, B are nilpotent matrices such that AB=BA, then A+B and AB are nilpotent. During a summer math program last summer, I took a class on ring theory. The following problem was part of the class homework: prove that the nilpotent elements of a commutative ring form an ideal. Due to the personal experience of having solved this problem during the summer, I was able to see that what was assigned in my class is simply a special case and could be solved similarly. As for &quot;so what&quot; and &quot;now what&quot;, my participation in a math camp made it easier for me to succeed in my classes (this was not the only example where prior knowledge helped me), and I plan on going to future summer math programs. 
</p>

<h4><u>2: Effect of living experience in Centreville with SDU on college experience.</u></h4>
There are 2 components: living on campus, and given that you are living on campus, living with other people from SDU. Living on campus has made it easy to go to on campus events and participate in clubs I enjoy, which has allowed me to meet new people and make new friends. Furthermore, not having to drive means that I can wake up a little later and get more sleep on most days. Living specifically in Centreville means that I run into people from my SDU class more frequently and can reach SDU related sites (offices, classrooms, places where events take place etc.) much faster. This has no significant effect on my college experience, although it is convenient to walk for 1 minute instead of 5 minutes when trying to visit some of my friends. 
</p>
<p>
<h4><u>3: SDU social events review</u></h4>
What the hell and the pizza advisory board meetings were useful and allowed me to discuss topics with people in SDU that I normally wouldn&#39;t have discussed at all. The opportunity to talk about what is going on in the news once every 2-3 weeks was nice, but the opportunity itself doesn&#39;t seem to matter much in the long run like most of our lives. In conclusion, nothing would change if WTH and PABM went away, but they are a great way to spend an hour on Thursdays if you weren&#39;t planning on doing anything else.  
</p>
<p>
<h4><u>4: Why we do service day and what it accomplishes</u></h4>
Service Day is literally community service, which is a way to give back to the community. The Scholars program makes people do community service to &quot;bond with your new classmates and faculty and staff in your Scholars program while making a difference in nearby communities&quot; (scholars.umd.edu). Clearly, we do get the opportunity to bond with new classmates and make a difference in nearby communities. Given how simple and direct the answers are, there&#39;s not much more I can say about this question. 
</p>
<p>
<h4><u>5: An excursion and how it relates to science</u></h4>
The New York trip was interesting because I got to go to the Museum of Natural History and see what it&#39;s like to eat in New York. I couldn&#39;t sleep on Friday, so I slept a lot on Saturday to catch up and missed my opportunity to tour the city. However, the museum was informative and allowed me to learn new facts about meteorites and the timeline of the universe. Also, I relearned what I had already known from a different perspective. The excursion only relates to science as much as the Museum of Natural History does given that everything outside the museum visit was not focused on science. The museum relates to science because it contains exhibits on various scientific topics. Nothing has changed about what I plan to do in the future, except that the next time I visit New York, I will bring a hat because walking around the city makes you cold much faster than you think (I am being honest here; winds are not a joke). 
</p>
<p>
<h4><u>6: Things to look forward to in spring 2020</u></h4>
I look forward to solving more math problems, completing a rigorous introductory course on abstract algebra instead of relying on what I know from browsing Wikipedia and Math Stackexchange, continuing to go to the Quizbowl, board games, and puzzle hunt clubs (3 separate clubs, not one that does all 3), learning more about measure theory and Lebesgue integration, struggling through C, the language without automatic garbage collection and pointer assignment, continuing to converse with Scholars fellows, getting another general education class (FSOC) requirement out of the way, receiving the results of the Putnam competition, and going to campus wide events again (Terps after Dark and many similar organizations ran out of gas by the end of September, but may restart in January). I dread the low amount of enthusiasm (the math club (&quot;the&quot; as there was only one club related to math) had one meeting in September to which only 6 people showed up, after which there were no more meetings and the club leader and club mailing list owner could not be reached by email) amongst the undergraduate math community in College Park, and look forward to the only on campus undergraduate math colloquium all year coming this spring (assuming the pattern and frequency of previous lectures continues).
