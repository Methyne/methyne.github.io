<u>Introduction and Statement of Purpose as of 2020/10/01</u>
</p>

<p>
My interests include solving challenging math problems, pondering over puzzling puzzles, playing Quizbowl, horseshoe integration, and board/card games. I plan to graduate from UMD,
enter an excellent math PhD program, get a PhD, and become a professor in math. Theorems, lemmas, conjectures, and ideas are all in my sights. Furthermore, that group of animals similar
to dolphins are to be given a box of chocolate bricks for their ever present excellence in traversing the global waters. Nevermind, that was my statement of porpoise. Anyways, all shades
of violet, magenta, mauve, and lavender are to be given one name to eliminate the scam that paint companies have forced upon us. Even the average American can see that all these "unique"
shades are just unremarkable and easily forgettable variations of one color. Once again, I messed up and included my statement of purple. Getting back to what you were looking for, anyone
who buys things online is just wasting their money. Money should be stored in a vault so that you don't lose it. Forget frivolous '''necessities''' such as food and water, the sole thing
you can and should spend your money on is a bigger vault so you can store more of your money. By the way, make sure to place all your credit cards, debit cards, checks, and important
documents into the vault to prevent identity theft. Why? It's a well kept secret among thieves that identity fraudsters are never frugal. They will blow all your money on Starbucks, dump
the cups on your lawn, mow your lawn, and then steal the yard trimmings. Disregard that, no one wants to hear more of my statement of purchase. My real statement of purpose? Sorry, it
doesn't exist because my statements were made on accident.
