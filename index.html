<u>About me</u>
</p>

<p>
I'm a 3rd year grad student at University of Delaware. My research interests are algebraic geometry, number theory, and graph theory. Learning more in algebraic geometry for the sake of building up the theory is exciting, and I canâ€™t wait to reach the frontier. As for number theory, I always found it amazing just how simple it is to state Diophantine equations, yet how hard it is to solve some of them. 
<br>Before Delaware, I was an undergrad at University of Maryland from 2019-2022. Before then, I was in high school, then middle school, then elementary, and finally came to exist in 2001 before later causing the Big Bang. I can never remember which way the arrow of time points. 
<br>Outside of math, I participate in many activities: pickleball, table tennis, quizbowl, tea club, and many student organizations. I founded the Newark card games club in 2022 and have taken it far, with 10-15 people meeting weekly and 450 people on the mailing list.
