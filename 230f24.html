<strong>Grade Breakdown:</strong> Discussion quizzes 10%, discussion attendance 2%, lecture attendance 3%, WebAssign homework 15%, paper & Canvas homework 10%, midterms 30%, final 30%
<br><br>

<strong>Discussion agenda:</strong> Discussion worksheets are given to whoever is there 5-10 minutes before class starts, and after that you can pick up one as you walk in. Once class starts, the attendance sheet gets passed around. If there are any exams or homeworks to pass back, I pass them back and you can ask for clarification on grading. If there was a quiz last week, I pass back the quizzes, go over common mistakes, and cover how students lost points so that people can improve. While things get passed back, keep working on the worksheet. After everything is passed back, I check on people's progress, give more time depending on progress and how much time is left in class, and go over solutions. If there is a quiz, then there's less time for the worksheet and I will cover solutions earlier. 
<br><br>
<strong>Quiz info:</strong> Quizzes are the last 20 minutes of discussion, closed note, no calculator, and happen on weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. Since I go over solutions and hand back quizzes the following week, you have 1 week to make it up by contacting me. For makeups, meet me at my office to get the quiz and take it in Ewing 107A or 107, whichever is free. 
<br><br>
<strong>Lecture info:</strong> Lectures are MWF 10:20-11:15 in Gore 205. Contact Kamal Joshi for more info or mog him in Mewing Hall 524.
<br><br>
<strong>Exam info:</strong> midterm 1 on 9/30 in class, midterm 2 on 11/4 in class, final 12/13 in Smith 120. Exams are closed notes, no calculator, no items, final destination only. Contact Kamal for makeups.
<br><br>
<strong>Regrade policy:</strong> If you have a problem with a homework, quiz, or exam given back during discussion, you <strong>must</strong> notify me before leaving the class. This is to prevent erasing or any other form of cheating.

<strong>General remarks:</strong> All info applies to all of my sections unless otherwise mentioned. No extra credit planned. Discussion worksheets, quizzes, and review material can be found at the bottom of this page. Worksheets posted in advance, quizzes after 1 week, exams after 1-2 weeks. Disability accommodations, exam &amp; lecture quiz makeups, and begging for extra credit is handled by the instructor. Email me about discussion quiz makeups or grade concerns.
