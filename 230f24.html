<br><br>

<strong>Accessing Materials:</strong> Anything related to discussions can be downloaded at the bottom of this page. Other documents like exams, exam solutions, and the general syllabus can also be downloaded. Some materials like written homeworks and lecture quizzes are not available. For those, go to Canvas or ask Kamal. 
<br><br>
<strong>Before Discussion:</strong> Students should try the worksheet before class. Worksheets can be downloaded here at least 2 days before the discussion.
<br><br>
<strong>Discussion agenda:</strong> Once class starts, the attendance sheet gets passed around. If there are any exams or homeworks to pass back, I pass them back and you can ask for clarification on grading. If there was a quiz last week, I pass back the quizzes, go over common mistakes, and cover how students lost points so that people can improve. For the worksheet, feel free to work in groups if you think this helps you understand the problems better. After everything is passed back, I ask which worksheet problems students would like to review, and problems are reviewed in first come first serve order. If no requests remain and there's time left before start of quiz or end of class, I will give a few minutes break in case people want to change their mind, and then either end class or start the quiz early, whichever is relevant, based on what students want. 
<br><br>
<strong>Quiz info:</strong> Quizzes are the last 20 minutes of discussion, closed note, no calculator, and happen every other week. Since I go over solutions and hand back quizzes the following week, you have 1 week to make it up by contacting me. For makeups, meet me at my office to get the quiz and take it in Ewing 107A or 107, whichever is free. 
<br><br>
<strong>Discussion and Quiz Solutions:</strong> Worksheet solutions are available for download after. Quiz solutions are available for download at the end of the week in which the quiz gets reviewed. 
<br><br>
<strong>Lecture info:</strong> Lectures are MWF 10:20-11:15 in Gore 205. Contact Kamal Joshi for more info or mog him in Mewing Hall 524.
<br><br>
<strong>Exam info:</strong> midterm 1 on 9/30 in class, midterm 2 on 11/4 in class, final 12/13 in Smith 120. Exams are closed note (with exception of one index card), no calculator, no items, final destination only. Contact Kamal for makeups.
<br><br>
<strong>Regrade policy:</strong> If you have a problem with a homework, quiz, or exam given back during discussion, you <strong>must</strong> notify me before leaving the class. This is to prevent erasing or any other form of cheating.

<p>
<strong>General remarks:</strong> All info applies to all of my sections unless otherwise mentioned. No extra credit planned. Discussion worksheets, quizzes, and review material can be found at the bottom of this page. Worksheets posted in advance, quizzes after 1 week, exams after 1-2 weeks. Disability accommodations, exam or lecture quiz makeups, and begging for extra credit is handled by the instructor.
