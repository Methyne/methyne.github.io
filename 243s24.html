General remarks: All info applies to all of my sections unless otherwise mentioned. Worksheets will appear in the files section of the 243 main Canvas page (24S-MATH243-010). Solutions are not uploaded until the end of all discussion sections per the instructor's request. Disability accomodations, exam &amp; lecture quiz makeups, and begging for extra credit is handled by the instructor. Email me about discussion quiz makeups or grade concerns.

Math discussion feedback form <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mathdiscussionfeedback">link</a>. Form open all semester, is anonymous, and only has one question.
</p>


<p>
Week of 2/5-2/9: Introduction to 3-space and vectors. 
</p>

<p>
Week of 2/12-2/16: Lines, planes, and quadric surfaces. Intersection of line segment and plane, then another line segment and plane 15 minutes later.  
</p>

<p>
Week of 2/19-2/23: Derivatives and integrals of vector functions, arc length and curvature. Discussion Quiz 1. 
</p>

<p>
Week of 2/26-3/1: Kinematics detour with velocity and acceleration. Limits and continuity in multiple variables.
</p>

<p>
Week of 3/4-3/8: Partial derivatives, tangent planes, linear approximations. 
</p>

<p>
Week of 3/11-3/15: Chains rule, do you got the chainz? Directional derivatives and the gradient. To Tuesday class: the shortcut for normal vector is incorrect. If u, v are parallel, it doesn't mean that the derivatives of u and v are parallel. This is because in the equation u = cv, c can vary with time. Thursday class: class is cancelled, all TAs and instructors will be grading the first exam.
</p>

<p>
Week of 3/18-3/22: Make Calculus Gradient Again. Maximum and minimum values, Lagrange multipliers. 
</p>

<p>
Week of 3/25-3/29: Spring break. Go to Hawaii and ask the locals for some advice on triple integrals. The volcanos are full of information, at least in the entropic sense. 
</p>

<p>
Week of 4/1-4/5: Lagrange Lagrange Lagrange. Double integrals over rectangles, then general regions.
</p>

<p>
Week of 4/8-4/12: Polar coordinates and triple integrals. Discussion quiz 2. 
</p>

<p>
Week of 4/15-4/19: Cylindrical and spherical coordinates
</p>

<p>
Week of 4/22-4/26: Vector fields, line integrals.
</p>

<p>
Week of 4/29-5/3: Fundamental theorem of line integrals, easy as pie. Green Green Green, pink up the phone. Yellow? It's curl and divergence calling.
</p>

<p>
Week of 5/6-5/10: Parametric surfaces and their areas, even the areas the government doesn't want you to know about. Divergence theorem. Discussion quiz 3. 
</p>

<p>
Week of 5/13-5/17: The final discussion: mega review. 
</p>

<p>
Week of 5/20-5/24: No classes, enjoy your summer.
