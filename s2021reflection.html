<h2><b>Spring 2021 Reflection </b></h2>
</p>

<p>
My capstone project is to learn graph theory at a graduate level by reading <i>Graph Theory</i> by Diestel and working on exercises in the book. The project began in February 2020 when I applied to the Directed Reading Program. After being paired with a mentor, I met with the mentor and director, and began to discuss what topic in math I should explore. After settling on a graph theory and then further deciding on the textbook <i>Graph Theory</i> by Diestel, I picked up a copy of the book and sent a project prospectus to the mentor and director detailing what I would cover. Obligations in the middle of March forced me to abandon the project and I would not return to it until 2021. At the end of January, I sent my mentor an email asking if he wanted to continue. Not receiving a response after a week, I reapplied to the directed reading program on February 7th and received a message from the director on February 18th stating that there were not enough available mentors.
</p>
<p>
To find a replacement mentor, I first considered contacting some graduate students at UMD. I was in a group with UMD math graduate students and considered asking through the group, but no one had posted anything in 2 months and so nothing happened due to inactivity. Before thinking of another way to reach out to UMD graduates, I remembered that I knew a student outside of UMD who has read Diestel&#39;s book far more than I have and would know how to benefit the most from reading the book, so I contacted him, and he agreed to be my mentor. My advice to future SDU scholars is to start working on your project early even if you&#39;re not required to turn in any paperwork until your last semester sophomore year. After taking a break in spring 2020, I could&#39;ve worked on my project in summer 2020, fall 2020, even winter 2020, but instead did nothing until February 2021, which made it harder to catch up. Also, if you started your capstone early in some semester without finishing by the end of that semester, don&#39;t assume the opportunity may still be available the next semester. You may have to continue independently like I did.
</p>
<p>
My original goal was to read the chapters and solve chapter exercises in sequential order: chapter 1, chapter 1 exercises, chapter 2, chapter 2 exercises, etc. However, my mentor Ivan recommended I choose an interesting chapter and focus on it deeply as the chapters are mostly self-contained and hence do not rely much on results and terms in earlier sections except for chapter 1. I personally chose to move onto chapter 3 after chapter 1. After chapter 3, I started working on chapter 4, which is what I&#39;m doing currently. My goal after chapter 4 is 5, then 7, 9. The book has much more material and content than a capstone needs anyways, so I will be able to continue working on exercises after the end of the spring 2021 semester. 
</p>
<p>
While solving the exercises from the end of the 1st chapter, I noticed that many problems hardly depended on the introduction at all. Several could be solved just by knowing the definitions of the terms in the question and prior knowledge. I also recognized a few exercises due to having done them before ever reading the book. There are some problems about modifying or generalizing theorems and lemmas from the chapter, and those require going back and carefully looking at the proofs, then seeing what needs to be changed. When reading chapter 3, I learned about just how dense a graduate level textbook can get. The chapter is only 14 pages, but lots of detail is crammed into every proof and definition. When Diestel writes &quot;clearly&quot; or &quot;it is easy to see that...&quot;, it may take anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes to understand why the observation that follows is true. Similarly, when a previous theorem or lemma is cited, exactly how it is applied is often left out. It may take hours to get through a proof that only takes up a few paragraphs. Although details were also hidden inside many small observations in chapter 1, it was not nearly at the same rate as chapter 3. The textbook contains decades of results by dozens of people in graph theory, and researchers make each jump in their proofs as large as possible without making it impossible to cross on your own. Such a method of writing has been chosen as the middle ground between code written in a formal theorem prover with every application of an axiom, definition, or earlier result spelled out with parameters describing what variables or objects are being used, how the axiom, definition, or result is used, and why it can be used (which would require further steps proving it is applicable), and no proofs at all.
</p>
<p>
Because my project focused on theoretical graph theory, I did not gain many practical connections between my academic focus of graph theory and other parts of society. However, I already know how graph theory can be applied to real world problems from all the algorithms I have learned in either in my CS classes or on my own time, so this is not an issue. My post-graduation plans have not been changed by the capstone. Even before entering UMD, I planned to get a PhD in math and become a math professor, and this is still my goal. My capstone has changed how I look at graduate level math textbooks since I now know much more about the differences between them and textbooks written for undergraduates, but besides this tiny change in perspective, I haven&#39;t changed my worldview.
