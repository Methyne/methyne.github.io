<h3><u>Fall 2019 Excursion: NYC Trip</u></h3>
<h4>American Museum of Natural History</h4>
<!-- Commented out
<h5>Exhibit 1: Hall of Meteorites</h5>
<br>
1. Scientists assumed that a meteorite would not be large enough to make the craters on the moon, i.e. meteorites around the crater were not what created the crater. They changed their mind when mining engineer Daniel Barringer noticed that pieces of debris around the crater were randomly mixed together in 1 layer. This mixing suggested that the meteorites fell at the same time the crater formed, and thus that the meteorite crash created the crater.
<br>
2. Meteoroids are rocks in outer space. When a meteoroid enters the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, it becomes a meteor and possibly burns up. If the meteor doesn&#39;t burn up and manages to hit the ground, it becomes a meteorite. Plaques: &quot;What is a Meteorite&quot; and &quot;Meteors/Meteor Showers&quot;.
<br>
3. Their high iron content comes from being made from the molten core of an asteroid (during melting but before the asteroid re-hardened, the iron sank to the asteroid&#39;s center). Chondritic meteorites are different since they did not form from the melting of another object.
<br>
4. Nobody could find the plaque. The meteorite is expected to be 11 to 81 km in diameter (https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6391), the crater has a diameter of 150 km and depth of 20 km (http://www.passc.net/EarthImpactDatabase/New%20website_05-2018/Chicxulub.html), and we expect a similarly sized object every 108 to 109 years (extrapolation based on chart in https://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/Natural_Disasters/impacts.htm).
<br>
5. Everyone left the exhibit early to get lunch, so I wasn&#39;t able to get a photo of the meteorite with SDU people in it.
<br>
<h5>Exhibit 2: Scales of the Universe</h5>
<br>
1. 13.25m
<br>
2. The radius of the Earth model is 12cm = 0.12m. The actual radius of the Earth is 6,370 km, so the Hayden sphere would represent something with a radius of 6370 * 13.25 / 0.24 â‰ˆ 703,000 km if the Earth was assumed to be properly scaled. The sun, which the sphere is supposed to represent at that point in the exhibit, has a radius of 696,000 km, so the exhibit is only off by 1%. Actual Earth/Sun radii were obtained from https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planetfact.html.

4. The equipment you are using starts to interfere with the observations and Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle comes into play. The particle an electron microscope bounces off an atom for imaging can significantly affect the course of that atom.
<br>
5. The largest, smallest scale in the exhibit is 1026 m, 10-15 m respectively. The largest scale is 26+15 = 41 orders of magnitude larger than the smallest scale. The human scale (1 = 100 m) is 15/41 = 37% between the smallest and the largest scale, closer to the smaller scale.
<br>
<h5>Exhibit 3: Self-guided tour</h5>
<br>
1: I toured the Heilbrunn Cosmic Pathway, which presents the timeline of the universe through astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. It also uses some geology to talk about the history of the Earth, which only starts during the last 4 billion years of the timeline.
<br>
2: The Big Bang, cosmic microwave background radiation, images of quasars, more images of quasars, the formation of the Earth, the Cambrian explosion, and so many pictures of quasars from the first few billion years of the universe that scientists have recently discovered. Also, the concept of red shift is repeatedly drilled into your head.
<br>
3: Every few hundred million years into the timeline, there is a plaque displaying an image of an object dating back to that point in the timeline. The z-value, measuring how much space has redshifted since then, is shown on each plaque to reinforce the concept of redshift. Information is also conveyed quite literally by distance: every meter you walk along the pathways represents 50 million years.
<br>
4: Based on how the most well-known events (in the timeline) such as the Big Bang and Cambrian explosion are explained, the hall is aimed at a middle school level. The definition of z-value is repeated on every single set of plaques for the first 1/3rd of the exhibit as if we risk forgetting it. However, everyone can enjoy walking in a spiral watching the history of the universe zoom past you. In that sense, the displays can be enjoyed by everyone.
<br>
5: I did not notice anything out of date.
<br>
6: I could not find any other SDU people in the exhibit to take a selfie with as everyone else who visited it had done so at an earlier time.

<h4>General thoughts <!--and Metropolitan Museum--></h4>
Greatest Display Item: I found the giant meteorite in the center of the meteorite hall slightly interesting. It quite clearly got across the point of how destructive and large meteorites can be. Unfortunately, I immediately forgot any technical details about where the meteorite came from or when it crashed into Earth, only remembering that it was massive (>10 tons) and it had an iron core. Still, the meteorite was more effective than the small plaques around it at conveying information.
<br><br>
On interactive vs static displays: Interactive displays are not directly more helpful than static displays, as they often convey the same or a smaller amount of information than comparable static ones. However, they make learning more fun, and it easier to remember what you are learning when you have fun learning it. This makes interactive displays indirectly more helpful for learning. I only saw 2 interactive displays: the scales showing your weight on other planets, and the butterfly garden. I did not learn anything from visiting them, but I could imagine that some of the elementary schoolers I saw around the exhibits were having fun and learning a lot from them, more so than they would from purely static exhibits.
<br><br>
Image from Metropolitan: I did not run into anyone in the museum after entering the modern art section, so the picture is just of the piece of art by itself. Here you can see Cheesus Crust impaled on a hyperpizza. Artists need to draw more higher dimensional objects.

Portions of the Met covered: I visited the entirety of the Modern and Contemporary art hall after starting from the entrance by the Greek and Roman art hall. My strategy was to follow the wall of the museum as if I was traversing a maze. This got me through rooms 162 (Greek & Roman art), 354 (New Guinean art), and 399 (benches; no art) before I ended up in 900 at the start of the modern art exhibit. I decided after entering the modern section that I would spend the rest of my time completing it for the sake of completion, and I successfully did so, getting through rooms 900-925.
<br><br>
Relation of trip to science and its purpose: The museum of natural history, despite the word &quot;history&quot;, contains a well-rounded display of science. The SDU organizers probably believe that all that science students learn about needs to be balanced out with some humanities in the form of art. University of Maryland is a university with a large general education program, so SDU having students go to an art museum instead of making the trip 100% about science probably checks off some item on the checklist that SDU organizers must go through so that the trip can receive funding. Whatever motivation SDU has in making us go to the Met was and is not a problem, as we were given freedom to travel through the art museum however we wished. If we were forced to visit specific, pre-determined sections of the Met, I would be complaining, but this is not the case.

<h3><u>Spring 2020 Excursion: Jamie Raskin Lecture</u></h3>
<h4>Thoughts on differences between leadership and public office</h4>
His triangle model of leadership doesn&#39;t seem too insightful. Anyone can make a polygon or polyhedron and then place a different word on each vertex or edge. Why a triangle and not a square, rectangle, rhombus, pentagon, tetrahedron, or even a rhombidodecadodecahedron? Jamie Raskin needs to come back to us with cooler shapes.
<br>
<h4>Favorite Question</h4>
I liked the question about how gerrymandering affects his district, especially since it means the political views of his constituents may change swiftly. He answered that it doesn&#39;t matter which party you vote for or who you support, his office will help you and has helped people with problems in the past. This is true for many congressmen, but we often don&#39;t think about the responsibilities that representatives have outside of Congress, law making, and campaigning.
<br>
<h4>On the question about &quot;if there&#39;s any hope&quot;</h4>
I didn&#39;t like the part that was just a clich&eacute; along the lines of &quot;children are our future&quot;. However, he managed to build off that principle and make some new points which I hadn&#39;t heard before. I agree with his point that given all the problems humans caused and then solved in the past, we will be able to handle climate change. However, he never mentioned exactly how much damage climate change will cause before we have it under wraps. The difference between striking a vital blow to global warming now and in 100 years could be trillions of dollars and millions of lives.
<br>
<h4>Criticism</h4>
Besides what I&#39;ve already mentioned, I could not remember any major disagreements with what Raskin stated. However, other parts of the event could&#39;ve been better. For example, the stickers that the organizers at the entrance handed out were generic Scholars stickers instead of something specific to the event. Also, barely any SDU freshmen showed up.
<br>
<h4>Ask your own question</h4>
I asked him after the presentation why there hasn&#39;t been bipartisan compromise of grandfathering in term limits. That is, why not settle the debate over Congressional term limits by passing a law that makes terms limits apply to future representatives (eventually, all current members will retire or die)? Raskin replied that people who oppose term limits aren&#39;t doing it merely out of self-interest. They believe in the idea that reelection solidifies a position and that anyone who wants a congress member to no longer be in Congress should just vote against them.

<h3><u>SDU social events review</u></h3>
What the hell and the pizza advisory board meetings were useful and allowed me to discuss topics with people in SDU that I normally wouldn&#39;t have discussed at all. The opportunity to talk about what is going on in the news once every 2-3 weeks was nice, but the opportunity itself doesn&#39;t seem to matter much in the long run like most of our lives. In conclusion, nothing would change if WTH and PABM went away, but they are a great way to spend an hour on Thursdays if you weren&#39;t planning on doing anything else.  
</p>
<p>
<h3><u>What did not happen</u></h3>
Trip to Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia? Cancelled! Scholars kickball tournament with opportunity to chew bubblegum and kick BSE ass? Cancelled! Perpetual NYC trip? Postponed to 2021! It is time to be pessimistic and predict that Scholars will not return to in-person events until fall 2021.
